# üêç venvty ‚Äì Terminal Utility

`venvty.py` is a simple terminal utility for managing Python virtual environments from the command line.

## Features
- List, create, activate, and delete virtual environments via CLI
- Choose Python version when creating a new venv
- Works cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac)

## Usage Example

List all venvs in the current directory (and subfolders):

```bash
python venvty.py list
```

Create a new venv in a folder called `myenv`:

```bash
python venvty.py create myenv
```

Delete a venv:

```bash
python venvty.py delete myenv
```

Activate a venv (opens a terminal with it activated):

```bash
python venvty.py activate myenv
```

You can specify a base directory for searching/creating venvs with `--base`:

```bash
python venvty.py list --base path/to/your/projects
```

You can also specify a Python executable when creating a venv:

```bash
python venvty.py create myenv --python path/to/python.exe
```
